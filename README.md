# css_dev_process

Treat index.css as a living example of many of the principles detailed in manifesto.md. If you want a raw template of that file when you create your own projects, you can copy and paste the code in template.css.

Open index.html to see the demo I walked through. Comment out the code at the bottom of index.css to see the code I added during the demo.

If you have any edits or resources, please fork this repo, add them to the manifesto, and submit a pull request! Odds are I'll approve it.
